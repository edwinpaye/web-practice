                        Melissa is a great mentor. She helped me to prepare for the interview and
                        provided me with valuable feedback on my projects. I would highly recommend her
                        to anyone who is looking for a mentor.

                        Melissa is awesome at explaining complex topics in a simple way. I have
                        learned a lot from her and would recommend her to anyone who is looking for a
                        mentor.
